  - Minimum serve duration (seconds, default: 2.0)
  - Maximum serve duration (seconds, default: 8.0)

### 3. Processing & Results
- **Processing Status**
  - Real-time progress bar with percentage
  - Step-by-step status updates:
    - "Uploading video..."
    - "Detecting player pose..."
    - "Identifying serve segments..."
    - "Extracting serve clips..."
    - "Generating analysis..."

- **Results Display**
  - Grid layout of extracted serve segments
  - Thumbnail previews with serve number
  - Duration and timestamp information
  - Download buttons for individual serves

### 4. Video Playback & Analysis
- **Video Player Features**
  - Standard video controls (play, pause, seek, volume)
  - Frame-by-frame navigation
  - Speed control (0.25x to 2x)
  - Fullscreen mode

- **Landmark Overlay Toggle**
  - On/off switch for pose landmarks
  - Different landmark visualization styles
  - Color-coded joint tracking

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Left-handed Player Handling
**Option A: Video Mirroring (Recommended)**
